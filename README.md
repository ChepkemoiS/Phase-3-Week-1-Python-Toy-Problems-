# Python Coding Challenges

This repository contains Python solutions to three coding challenges.

## Challenges

### Challenge 1: Minimum Moves to Equal Bricks

Given an array `A` representing the number of bricks in each box, the goal is to determine the minimum number of moves required to end up with exactly 10 bricks in every box.

Example:
- For `A = [7, 15, 10, 8]`, the minimum number of moves is 7.

### Challenge 2: Maximum Sum of Two Numbers

Given an array `A` of integers, find the maximum sum of two numbers whose digits add up to an equal sum.

Example:
- For `A = [51, 71, 17, 42]`, the maximum sum is 93.

### Challenge 3: Generating a String of Length N

Given an integer `N`, generate a string containing as many different lower-case letters ('a' - 'z') as possible, with each letter occurring an equal number of times.

Example:
- For `N = 5`, a possible string is "abcde".

## Solutions

- Challenge 1: [Solution 1](challenge1_solution.py)
- Challenge 2: [Solution 2](challenge2_solution.py)
- Challenge 3: [Solution 3](challenge3_solution.py)

## Usage

Each Python file contains a function `solution()` that solves the respective challenge. You can test the solutions by passing appropriate inputs.

## Assumptions and Constraints

- Challenge 1: The number of boxes (`N`) ranges from 1 to 200,000.
- Challenge 2: The array `A` may contain integers of varying lengths.
- Challenge 3: The integer `N` is within the range [1, 200,000].
